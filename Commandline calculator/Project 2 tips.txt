read through the whole command line and check to make sure there is a " " for every odd agrv.
If not don't process and just complain(e.g: 3 4 * p [is okay] but 3 4 *p [is not okay])
Use two stacks (one for the operands and the operators)
EX. 3 4 * 100 - p
	Should read in 2 numbers first, if it reads and operator before 2 numbers, then error
	You will pop operands and operators from the stacks
	First operand is place on the right of the operator, second is placed on the left of the operator
	the result is then pushed back into the operand stack
	collect the next operand from the command line and that goes on top
	you should collect a operation next or else error
	the same applies with the math and the result is placed in the operand stack
	
EX.  3 4 100 * - p
	100 and 4 are read first and processed with the * first
	store the result
	next 3 and 400 are subtracted and result is stored in the operand stack.
	
Setprecision should be set to 0 by default
